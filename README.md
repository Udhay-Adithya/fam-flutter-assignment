# 📋 Contextual Cards Container  

### 🎯 **Overview**  
This repository contains the implementation of a **standalone container** for displaying a list of `Contextual Cards`. These cards are dynamically rendered from JSON responses fetched via an API and styled based on their properties such as text, colors, images, and CTAs.

The container is **plug-and-play**, meaning it can be seamlessly added to any Flutter screen or widget without dependencies on the rest of the app.

## 🚀 Features  

- **Dynamic Card Rendering**: Cards are rendered based on API responses, supporting various `design_types`.  
- **Actionable CTAs**: Handles all deeplinks for cards and buttons dynamically.  
- **Gesture Features**:
  - **Swipe Down** to refresh the list.  
  - **Long Press** on Big Display Card (HC3) to display action buttons (`Remind Later`, `Dismiss Now`).  
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling using **Cubit** (part of Bloc).  
- **Persistence**:
  - Cards marked as `Remind Later` reappear on the next app start.  
  - Cards marked as `Dismiss Now` never appear again.  
- **Beautiful UI**: Matches the design specifications as closely as possible using assets from Figma.  
- **Clean Architecture**: Implements a structured and modular project design for scalability and maintainability.

## 📡 API Details  

The app fetches data from the following API:  
`https://polyjuice.kong.fampay.co/mock/famapp/feed/home_section/?slugs=famx-paypage`  

Each API response includes **Card Groups**, which are rows of cards, with details about their layout, content, and behavior. For detailed schema, refer to the assignment instructions or inspect the API response directly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Flutter**  
- **Dart**  
- **Cubit** (for state management)  
- **HTTP** (for API requests)  
- **Shared Preferences** (for persistence)  
- **Get it** (for dependency injection)

## 🎨 Card Types Supported  

The app supports the following `design_types` as per the API schema:  
1. **Small Display Card** (`HC1`)  
2. **Big Display Card** (`HC3`)  
3. **Image Card** (`HC5`)  
4. **Small Card with Arrow** (`HC6`)  
5. **Dynamic Width Card** (`HC9`)

### Why I Skipped the Domain Layer

In a small project like this, the **domain layer**—typically responsible for defining business logic and use cases—can introduce unnecessary complexity without providing substantial benefits. Skipping the domain layer ensures simplicity, as the minimal business logic can be handled directly in the `Cubit` or `Repository` layers. This approach reduces development time, enabling focus on functionality, UI, and testing. Moreover, the emphasis in this assignment is on delivering a functional, clean, and maintainable app rather than strict adherence to architectural patterns. By directly connecting the `Cubit` to `Repositories` and `Data Sources`, we achieve a balance between modularity and simplicity without sacrificing code quality.

## 📝 Notes  

1. **Persistence**: Local storage is handled using SharedPreferences for managing dismissed and remind-later card states.  
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API and app state.  
3. **Modular Design**: Adopts clean architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.
